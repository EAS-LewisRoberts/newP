This repo is the provisioning of 4 VM's and the capturing of each of the VM's IP address 

- To use git clone the repo, then run by using the following command:

Terraform apply

- upon input of this command, the script should run without any issues. 
- it should then provision 4 VM's and capture their IP addresses.
- nexusrm and 
- jenkins 

This will allow the full funtion of the project. 

Data will be queried at the initial config stage within the main.tf. The VMâ€™s IP will be captured and will have output to my local machine in an inventory file. Then you can apply the configuration and inspect the output values.

Use "terraform apply"

- upon input of this command, the script should run without any issues. 
- it should then provision 4 VM's and capture their IP addresses.
